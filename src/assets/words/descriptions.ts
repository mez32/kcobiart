export const aboutMe = `Throughout the years I have learned that my Iranian and American friends, we all
have one trait in common. They do not respond to what happens in their life
time, instead they respond to their past. Past traumas and what they go
through as a child shapes how we all respond to our present disregard to our
cultural background. I have been breaking my personal road blocks that were
built by my past to live life as a free spirited person that appreciates the
past but doesn’t let it dictate my future. Art being a huge part of my
tenacious mindset. May you face your unveiled version of who you are through
my paintings. Here is a mirror for you to overcome your past.`

The minute I heard my first love story,
I started looking for you, not knowing
how blind that was.
Lovers don't finally meet somewhere.
They're in each other all along.

“ In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art.”
Rumi

“ I speak out of the deep of night 
out of the deep of darkness 
and out of the deep of night I speak. 
If you come to my house, friend 
bring me a lamp and a window I can look through 
at the crowd in the happy alley.”

export const capture = `
But one night, 
I will wear a mask- 
made of the thirst- 
of the remotest shores, 
and their desert islands. 
And I’ll capture you- in my absorbing sands, 
forever far away- from your naval natal lands.
