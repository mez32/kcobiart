export const aboutMe = `Throughout the years I have learned that my Iranian and American friends, we all
have one trait in common. They do not respond to what happens in their life
time, instead they respond to their past. Past traumas and what they go
through as a child shapes how we all respond to our present disregard to our
cultural background. I have been breaking my personal road blocks that were
built by my past to live life as a free spirited person that appreciates the
past but doesnâ€™t let it dictate my future. Art being a huge part of my
tenacious mindset. May you face your unveiled version of who you are through
my paintings. Here is a mirror for you to overcome your past.`
